# Awesome Databases for AI Systems

> A curated survey of database systems, design patterns, and architectural practices in modern AI systems including multi-agent frameworks, RAG pipelines, and LLM applications.

## 🎯 About This Project

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource collection exploring the evolving role of databases in AI-native systems. As AI applications grow in complexity—from simple chatbots to sophisticated multi-agent systems—the database layer has become a critical component that goes far beyond traditional data storage.

**Research Focus:**
- How do databases enable coordination in multi-agent systems?
- What are the emerging database patterns for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?
- How do vector databases integrate with traditional databases in AI architectures?
- What are the performance and consistency trade-offs in AI-native data systems?
