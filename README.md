# Awesome Databases for AI Systems

A curated list of papers and systems on how database technologies serve as the infrastructure layer of modern AI systems, including training pipelines, feature platforms, vector retrieval, LLM memory systems, and database-native AI execution.

This repository aims to systematically organize research and practice at the intersection of:

- Database Systems
- AI/ML/LLMs
- System Optimization
